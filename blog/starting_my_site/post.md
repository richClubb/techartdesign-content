# Creating a Website

I've always resisted creating a website or getting involved in any web technologies as I used to look down on anything related to web technology. I think it was that a lot of sites of old used to be quite naff and I just thought that "real" programmers worked on respectable tools!

This is an utter load of bollocks! So I've started working on doing more things web related. I don't think I'll ever really be a web developer as I've just spent too much time doing C and low level stuff, and I prefer working on embedded systems as I like controlling things that work in the real world.

I've had a couple of ideas recently that would have benefitted from being able to quickly deploy something on a site, and as I now have free Azure credits by working for Microsoft I thought it was a good excuse to use them.

## Plans!

I think I'll start by just putting up a simple (ish) site. I don't want to go pure HTML as A) I hate HTML. I don't know what it is, but i really hate writing HTML. B) I want to use some programming nouse to actually try and make my life easier.

The details are up on my [project page](/projects/website) but I chose Flask as my framework. It uses python, and is fairly lightweight so I thought this was a good choice.


## The Future

* I want to play around with Kubernetes and Docker, try to get this into a properly scalable site.
* Play around with Webasembly.
* Play around with Web games.

Hopefully this should keep me occupied for a bit, and can easily be done in the evenings rather than a lot of my other projects which require either daylight or things that make noise.
