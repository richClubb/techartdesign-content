# Makers

These are makers or people who have given me some inspiration.

## [3x3 Custom](https://www.youtube.com/c/3x3CustomTamar)

A US based woodworker who has a great variety of sensible projects and designs. A great sense of design and isn't afraid to experiment and publish mistakes.

They have a mostly power-tool based approach and doesn't tend to use a lot of hand-tools. They don't have a crazy tool collection and has a lot of really good methods and jigs to make up some of the shortfalls in equipment equipment.

### Topics

Woodworking, design


## [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere)

Great sense of humor and a variety of cool projects. They make some really strange projects, some of which are not really easily DIY as they require a lot of tools, but the ideas are really cool.

Mental tool collection... Definitely uses them, but just wow.

### Topics

Maker, electronics, programming, mechanical


## [Chris Salomone](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisSalomone1)

They have a really impressive design eye and make some great looking furniture. They outline a lot of their design methodology which is really cool if you're trying to learn about design.

Primarily power-tool focused, and their sense of humor can be a little grating.

## [Ishitani Furniture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7FkqjV8SU5I8FCHXQSQe9Q)

A Japanese woodworker. I can't describe how amazing their designs are, and watching them make furniture is medative. I can easily just sit and watch it for hours. I'd love to be able to actually go to Japan to see their work in person.

I definitely aspire to actually own one of their pieces.

Has a hybrid approach and uses a good mix of power and hand tools. Their tool collection is very old school and very cool.

### Topics

## [Squarerule Furniture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkUhZ4Zlk6HTmeV-M4q06g)

A Korean woodworker with some amazing designs. Like Ishitani Furniture his videos are very meditative and I can easily watch them for hours.

Has a hybrid approach to woodworking.

## [Kobeomsuk furniture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVOpX2P5wygh7sB1KXgh_5g)

A Korean woodworker with great designs. Similar to Ishitani and Squarerule in their videos and presentation. Has some great live edge designs, [this one in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKa7H4ldksw) is a real inspiration.

Has a hybrid approach to woodworking.

## [Laura Kampf](https://www.youtube.com/c/laurakampf)

German based maker, focuses on wood and metalworking. Has a really good design focusing more on industrial / bare designs rather than uber clean commercial furniture.

Has a real flair for making good stuff out of old things. Their piece on the [bench they made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbQGLaLDEA4) on the Rhine River is a really cool way of thinking

### Topics

## [Jeremy Fielding](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeremyFieldingSr)

A really interesting self-taught mechanical engineer. Really good advice for engineering and tends to focus on re-using things rather than buying them new.

### Topics

## [Alexandre Chappel](https://www.youtube.com/c/achappel)

A huge inspiration for cool projects. A mixture of great designs and cool methods. I'd recommend looking as their [assortment boxes](https://www.alch.shop/shop/p/assortment-system-master-set) which are super useful and I have them set up in some of my organisation boxes at home.

### Topics

Woodworking, maker.


## [Stumpy Nubs](https://www.youtube.com/c/StumpyNubs)

US based woodworker. Has a hybrid woodworking method (power tools and hand tools). I'd recommend following them as they are just super sensible and have a lot of good common sense advice.

### Topics

Woodworking, just good old common sense.

A list of useful stores that I use for parts / supplies. I've skipped out some of the obvious ones (RS Supplies, Farnell).
