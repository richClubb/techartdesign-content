# Woodworking

Since the COVID lockdowns I've been getting into woodworking as a way to get away from my computer and these have been a couple of my projects.

## Monitor / Laptop Stands

Since playing around with some ergonomics and learning about keybords I realised how bad most monitors are for customisation and height adjustment. Most basic ones don't actually go up to the "correct" height for most people so I decided to make some monitor stands to raise them up to a good height. Similarly, people who have laptops as their work computer end up with them on the desk rather than raising them up to a good eye level.

Most of them I've given away to colleagues or people at the hackspace, asking for donations to charity as a thank you. They allow me to practice my joinery rather than just making joints which is a bit of a waste of wood.

Most of the wood is made from wood from [T. H. Hardwood](https://thhardwoods.weebly.com/). I'm trying to be as sustainable as possible and the wood comes from my local area.

### Basic Dovetail

This was a laptop stand for a colleague, they were using a box to raise their laptop up but I thought this would look a little nicer.

There were some mistakes with the dovetails but it was a good learning experience, especially trying to correct said mistakes. Overall pretty happy, and my colleague was as well.

The wood from this was from a batch from [Surrey Timbers](https://www.surreytimbers.co.uk/). Not sure if they do rough planed boards any more, although their slabs are fantastic.

### Walnut Live Edge Laptop Stand

This was an experiment to use up some scrap from another project and I was really happy. I made one or two mistakes cutting the wrong part on the bandsaw but the way the live edges work on the bottom of the laptop arm is a nice touch. I liked adding a bowtie inlay even though I think it was a little unnecessary.

I had previously made a stand similar to this out of a single piece of wood, but it suffered from a critical problem in that the grain direction created weaknesses that could lead to failuure. This way is a little more messy but isn't weak.

### Yew Monitor Stands

I picked up some nice pieces of Yew

And turned them into this

This was the first experiment with a mitred joint and bowties. It was pretty successful but I did get some warping of the board which wasn't ideal. I think I needed to season the board more.

The left hand boards got turned into another monitor stand

### Walnut and Ash Monitor Stand

I made this for myself. I love the look of the half blind dovetails. The top is English Walnut and the sides is English Ash

These were tricky but well worth the effort for the look.

### Kerf Bent

I saw a great video from [Foureyes Furniture](https://youtu.be/KFGpi5yoz8U?si=5ZVqpnC34PnhNPF5) and thought the look was great and using crayons was a fantastic idea.

This was a cool experiment but there are some tricky things,
1. The blowout from the saw was extreme. You need to use a fine toothed blade to do the kerf cuts and support the part where the blade exits
2. The melted crayon seeps into the endgrain so the next one I'm going to try a mica powder expoy pour.
