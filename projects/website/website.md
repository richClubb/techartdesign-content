# Website

Creating a website.

## Brief



## Initial Ideas

* Find a good technology which isn't too heavyweight
* Experiment with cluster systems as well as the web technology
* Two part design, one for the framework and another for the content.

## Research

Initially I thought about using Python as the main framework technology. I'm familiar with Python so I though this was a good plan.

Flask is a lightweight framework which as a stupidly good support base. It seemed to tick a lot of the boxes. E.g. support for rendering markdown which can be used for creating and maintaining the content.

I thought of using Python as the basis for the site as I heard it was becoming popular and I have some familiarity with it, Flask seemed like a good option as it was lightweight, and very scalable.

Rather than using HTML, I also found that flask and python had mechanisms to render markdown into HTML which meant that the content could be easily written in a much more friendly language.

That was about as far as I got with the research

* [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/index.html)
* [Configuring Flask with Apache](https://www.thegeeksearch.com/setup-flask-with-apache-and-wsgi/)
* [Rendering Markdown with Flask](https://blog.jcharistech.com/2019/12/12/how-to-render-markdown-in-flask/)

These were all super useful tutorials and provided the basis of the design.

## Layout and Content

I think to start I just want to make it simple, so a heading, site nav, then the main text is split into the page nav and the content.

Most of what I want to get across by this is notes / details for my projects, possibly blog posts.
